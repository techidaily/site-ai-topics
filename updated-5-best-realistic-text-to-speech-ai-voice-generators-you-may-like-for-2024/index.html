<h3 id="1-Migration-Travel-and-Settlements"><a href="#1-Migration-Travel-and-Settlements" class="headerlink" title="1. Migration, Travel, and Settlements"></a>1. Migration, Travel, and Settlements</h3><p>Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions.

Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.</p>
<h3 id="2-Colonization-and-Imperialism"><a href="#2-Colonization-and-Imperialism" class="headerlink" title="2. Colonization and Imperialism"></a>2. Colonization and Imperialism</h3><p>The British Empire’s expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements.
