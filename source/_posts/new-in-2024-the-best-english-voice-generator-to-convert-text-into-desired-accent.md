## Part 1: How Many English Accents are Available All Over The World

English has become one of the most commonly recognized languages around the world. Many countries across the globe speak English as a first or second language. The diversity of English language accents lies specifically in this fact. This is also proof of the language’s adaptability and rich cultural history.

Assigning an exact number to the English accents spoken globally is challenging. Accents vary greatly with regions. Sometimes even the same city can produce multiple accents of the same language. Yet, linguists suggest that an estimated 160 accents exist in the English language worldwide. While it is difficult to touch all the different accents in one sitting, here are some commonly spoken ones:

1. Received Pronunciation
2. Yorkshire
3. Scottish
4. Welsh
5. Cockney
6. Irish
7. Southern American
8. Australian
9. Canadian
10. South African

## Part 2: What Are The Reasons Behind Different English Accents

Several factors contribute to the incredible diversity found in the English language. A range of features can influence accents, some of which include the following:

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature. As a result, several variations have occurred in accents and dialects.

In the world of gadgets and gizmos, our devices have become a regular part of our lives, making things easier and more interesting. Among all these cool things, there's one feature that's kind of sneaky but really useful – it's called Text-to-Speech (TTS) on iPhones. These days we're always busy and there's so much stuff going on, **iPhone text to speech** is like a helper that makes things smoother. It helps us do lots of things at once and understand stuff better.

So, in this guide, we're going to learn how to make your iPhone talk to you i.e. **iPhone read text**, **iPhone read text out loud**, **speak text iPhone** on **text to speech app iPhone** and make life cooler. We'll find out how to turn on this cool trick and see all the good stuff it brings. Let's get started and make your iPhone a chatty buddy!

## Part 1: What is Text-to-Speech?

Text-to-Speech, as the name suggests, is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. This powerful function has gained immense popularity due to its diverse range of applications. Imagine scenarios where you're driving and need to access an important email, or you're cooking while following a recipe from a website. Without the **text to speech app iPhone** function, these situations could be both inconvenient and potentially unsafe.

This **voice text message iPhone** function transcends mere convenience; it's an accessibility boon for those with visual impairments or learning disabilities. Moreover, it caters to various learning styles by offering an auditory alternative to traditional text-based content. From educational content to news articles, eBooks to social media updates, TTS ensures that you're never tied down by the limitations of visual reading alone.

## Part 2: How to Enable the TTS Function on iPhone?

Enabling **iPhone** **t** **ext** **to s** **peech** function is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to harness the power of auditory content consumption:

#### Step 1

Begin by locating and tapping the "Settings" app icon on your iPhone's home screen. The "Settings" app can be identified by its gear icon. This action will lead you to a menu where you have the ability to adjust and configure various settings for your device.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

The "Accessibility" icon typically features a simple representation of a person enclosed within a circle. Tapping on this icon will reveal another menu tailored to settings that cater to different user needs, making your device more user-friendly.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-2.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-2.jpg)

#### Step 3

The icon associated with "Spoken Content" is usually characterized by a speaker or text bubble icon accompanied by some text. When you select this option, a new menu will emerge, offering features that allow you to enable and customize the text-to-speech function or **speak screen iPhone**.

#### Step 5

To make the most of the text-to-speech feature, proceed to any app or area where text is present. Tap and hold your finger on the specific text you wish to hear aloud or **iPhone read text out loud**. This action will summon a tool known as the "selector tool," which is represented by a blue, yellow and any other color bar. The selector tool empowers you to highlight text by dragging its handles located at both ends.

For a Single Word

Above the selector tool, you'll notice an option labeled "Speak." Tap on "Speak" and your device will instantly pronounce the selected word audibly.

For Multiple Words or Entire Content

Should you intend to have all the text on the screen read aloud, tap "Select All," another option visible above the selector tool. This action will encompass all the available text. Subsequently, tap on "Speak," which is now positioned beside options such as "Copy" and "Share." Tapping "Speak" will prompt your device to audibly relay all the selected text.
