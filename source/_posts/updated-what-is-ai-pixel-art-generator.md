## Part 1: What is AI Text to Speech?

AI text to speech (TTS) is the cutting-edge technology that utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to convert written text into natural-sounding spoken language. By analyzing the textual input, AI TTS systems generate audio output that simulates human speech, incorporating elements such as intonation, rhythm, and emphasis. This advanced technology enables computers and devices to communicate with users using lifelike and expressive voices.
