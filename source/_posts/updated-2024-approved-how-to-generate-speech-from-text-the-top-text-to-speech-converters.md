## Part 1: What is Text-to-Speech?

Text-to-Speech, as the name suggests, is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. This powerful function has gained immense popularity due to its diverse range of applications. Imagine scenarios where you're driving and need to access an important email, or you're cooking while following a recipe from a website. Without the **text to speech app iPhone** function, these situations could be both inconvenient and potentially unsafe.

From educational content to news articles, eBooks to social media updates, TTS ensures that you're never tied down by the limitations of visual reading alone.

## Part 2: How to Enable the TTS Function on iPhone?

Enabling **iPhone** **t** **ext** **to s** **peech** function is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to harness the power of auditory content consumption:

#### Step 1

Begin by locating and tapping the "Settings" app icon on your iPhone's home screen. The "Settings" app can be identified by its gear icon. This action will lead you to a menu where you have the ability to adjust and configure various settings for your device.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

Within the "Settings" menu, scroll through the options until you spot the "Accessibility" section. The "Accessibility" icon typically features a simple representation of a person enclosed within a circle. Tapping on this icon will reveal another menu tailored to settings that cater to different user needs, making your device more user-friendly.

#### Step 5

To make the most of the text-to-speech feature, proceed to any app or area where text is present. Tap and hold your finger on the specific text you wish to hear aloud or **iPhone read text out loud**. This action will summon a tool known as the "selector tool," which is represented by a blue, yellow and any other color bar. The selector tool empowers you to highlight text by dragging its handles located at both ends.

For a Single Word

Above the selector tool, you'll notice an option labeled "Speak." Tap on "Speak" and your device will instantly pronounce the selected word audibly.

For Multiple Words or Entire Content

Should you intend to have all the text on the screen read aloud, tap "Select All," another option visible above the selector tool. This action will encompass all the available text. Subsequently, tap on "Speak," which is now positioned beside options such as "Copy" and "Share." Tapping "Speak" will prompt your device to audibly relay all the selected text.

#### Step 5

Below the language and voice menus, you will see four sliders that allow you to adjust the pitch, speed, volume, and effects of your character’s voice. You can use these sliders to make your character sound more funny or realistic. For example, if you want to make your character sound more high-pitched or low-pitched, you can move the pitch slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more fast or slow, you can move the speed slider to the left or right. If you want to make your character sound more loud or soft, you can move the volume slider to the left or right. If you want to add some effects to your character’s voice, such as echo or reverb, you can move the effects slider to the left or right.

#### Step 6

Below the sliders, you will see a box where you can type or paste your text that you want your character to say aloud. You can use up to 1000 characters per request for this box. You can also use SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) tags to add some pauses, emphasis, or other effects to your speech. SSML is a standard way of controlling how text is spoken by a speech synthesizer. You can use SSML tags by enclosing them in angle brackets (< >). For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons. Isolated communities often develop distinct accents due to limited interactions. More commonly, English-speaking populations have migrated and settled in various regions, blending the local language and native English accents. Due to this mixing, new and unique accents emerge.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism

The British Empire's expansion era resulted in several colonial settlements. As a result, English was spread to numerous territories and far-off places in the world. The amalgamation of English with local languages and dialects gave rise to unique accents such as Indian and African English.

### 3\. Media and Entertainment

Media has always been a powerful communication and a great way to spread your word. People often copy speech patterns observed in mainstream media and entertainment. These include movies, TV shows, and music. This can lead to the development of certain distinct accents and dialects. This particularly occurs in regions that have high media exposure.

### 4\. Education and Socioeconomic Factors

Certain accents have been associated with distinct socioeconomic factors. Higher levels of education are often associated with more standardized and prestigious accents. Other influences such as occupation, social identity, and community also play a key role in determining the varying accents of individuals.

### 5\. Linguistic Drifts and Age

Linguistic drift is a natural process that helps languages evolve. Like most languages, English has also undergone linguistic drift. This phenomenon has caused notable changes in various language features. These changes can be of phonological and grammatical nature. As a result, several variations have occurred in accents and dialects.
