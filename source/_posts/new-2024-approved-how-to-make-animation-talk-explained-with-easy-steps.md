## Bonus: What Kind of Anime Pictures Are Suitable to Make Talking Animation

As we have mentioned before, you can also upload anime photos in Wondershare Virbo and make the animated character talk. However, you need to note that these photos must meet specific criteria to ensure optimal results in your animations before trying on **how to make animation talk**.

Some anime picture specifications you can use to make a talking cartoon video:

1. **Having clear features**

Opt for anime pictures with well-defined and easily recognizable features to achieve more accurate results. Wondershare Virbo usually won’t detect anime pictures with simple lines or undefined lines.

1. **Free of copyright infringement**

 It's essential to use images that are free from any copyright restrictions or infringement. Only use anime character photos that you have the legal right to use, whether they are from your personal collection or obtained from royalty-free sources.

1. **Proper lighting and resolution**

Images with proper lighting and high resolution are essential for achieving crisp and detailed animations. Avoid images that are overly dark, blurry, or pixelated, as they may result in less visually appealing animations.

1. **Facing forward with a clear and visible face**

Select images where the anime character is facing forward and their face is clearly visible. This allows for precise facial animation, including lip-syncing and expression changes, which are key elements in creating realistic talking animations.
