For example, if you want to add a pause of half a second between two words, you can use the tag <break time=“500ms”/> between them. If you want to add some emphasis on a word or phrase, you can use the tag <emphasis> around them.

![oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/oddcast-text-to-speech-demo-6.jpg)
