## Demystifying AI Game Generators: From Definition to Distinction

## Part 1\. Explanation of what AI game generators are

An AI game generator is a cutting-edge software or system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate and enhance various aspects of game development. It harnesses the power of machine learning, neural networks, and other AI methodologies to create, design, or assist in the creation of video games. Unlike traditional game development methods that heavily rely on manual design and coding, AI game generators offer a more automated and efficient approach.

## Part 2\. How do AI game generators differ from traditional game development methods?
