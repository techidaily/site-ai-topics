## Part 1\. What is iPhone Talking Emoji or Animoji?

Animoji is an Apple feature that transforms specific emoji icons into short, customized animations using your facial expressions and voice.

You can make and share Animoji with other Apple users through the Messages app. There are over 25 of these iPhone talking emojis available, including your own avatar, poop, panda, pig, robot, and ghost that can mirror your facial expressions.

## Part 2\. How Does iPhone Talking Emoji Work?

Ever tried those fun Snapchat lenses? The **talking emoji on Apple** devices works in a similar fashion to Snapchat lenses. But instead of relying on custom masks from Snapchat, it uses popular emojis.

Animoji takes advantage of the TrueDepth camera system and the iPhone's internal chip to use Face ID technology. Apple first introduced Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X. Now, all newer iPhone models come equipped with Face ID.

So you can use and make Animoji on iPhone X or later. You can also use it on the iPad Pro 11-inch or the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) and newer models.
