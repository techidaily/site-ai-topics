In the world of gadgets and gizmos, our devices have become a regular part of our lives, making things easier and more interesting. Among all these cool things, there's one feature that's kind of sneaky but really useful – it's called Text-to-Speech (TTS) on iPhones. These days we're always busy and there's so much stuff going on, **iPhone text to speech** is like a helper that makes things smoother. It helps us do lots of things at once and understand stuff better.

So, in this guide, we're going to learn how to make your iPhone talk to you i.e. **iPhone read text**, **iPhone read text out loud**, **speak text iPhone** on **text to speech app iPhone** and make life cooler. We'll find out how to turn on this cool trick and see all the good stuff it brings. Let's get started and make your iPhone a chatty buddy!

## Part 1: What is Text-to-Speech?

Text-to-Speech, as the name suggests, is a technology that converts written text into spoken words. This powerful function has gained immense popularity due to its diverse range of applications. Imagine scenarios where you're driving and need to access an important email, or you're cooking while following a recipe from a website. Without the **text to speech app iPhone** function, these situations could be both inconvenient and potentially unsafe.

This **voice text message iPhone** function transcends mere convenience; it's an accessibility boon for those with visual impairments or learning disabilities. Moreover, it caters to various learning styles by offering an auditory alternative to traditional text-based content. From educational content to news articles, eBooks to social media updates, TTS ensures that you're never tied down by the limitations of visual reading alone.

## Part 2: How to Enable the TTS Function on iPhone?

Enabling **iPhone** **t** **ext** **to s** **peech** function is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to harness the power of auditory content consumption:

#### Step 1

Begin by locating and tapping the "Settings" app icon on your iPhone's home screen. The "Settings" app can be identified by its gear icon. This action will lead you to a menu where you have the ability to adjust and configure various settings for your device.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-1.jpg)

#### Step 2

Within the "Settings" menu, scroll through the options until you spot the "Accessibility" section. The "Accessibility" icon typically features a simple representation of a person enclosed within a circle. Tapping on this icon will reveal another menu tailored to settings that cater to different user needs, making your device more user-friendly.

#### Step 3

Inside the "Accessibility" menu, look for and tap on the "Spoken Content" option. The icon associated with "Spoken Content" is usually characterized by a speaker or text bubble icon accompanied by some text. When you select this option, a new menu will emerge, offering features that allow you to enable and customize the text-to-speech function or **speak screen iPhone**.

#### Step 4

Within the "Spoken Content" menu, among the various options available, locate "Speak Selection." This should be the first choice in the menu. Toggle the switch adjacent to "Speak Selection" into the ON position. By activating this option which is **read text out loud iPhone**, you grant your device the ability to audibly communicate the selected text.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-4.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-4.jpg)

#### Step 5

To make the most of the text-to-speech feature, proceed to any app or area where text is present. Tap and hold your finger on the specific text you wish to hear aloud or **iPhone read text out loud**. This action will summon a tool known as the "selector tool," which is represented by a blue, yellow and any other color bar. The selector tool empowers you to highlight text by dragging its handles located at both ends.

For a Single Word

Above the selector tool, you'll notice an option labeled "Speak." Tap on "Speak" and your device will instantly pronounce the selected word audibly.

For Multiple Words or Entire Content

Should you intend to have all the text on the screen read aloud, tap "Select All," another option visible above the selector tool. This action will encompass all the available text. Subsequently, tap on "Speak," which is now positioned beside options such as "Copy" and "Share." Tapping "Speak" will prompt your device to audibly relay all the selected text.

![text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-5.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/features/text-to-speech/text-to-speech-function-on-iphone-5.jpg)
