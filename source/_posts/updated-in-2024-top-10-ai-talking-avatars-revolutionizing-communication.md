## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

Despite its potential, **making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

### ● **Technical Limitations**

Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

### ● **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**

Besides technical hurdles, ethical and privacy issues arise with talking photo technology. Manipulating visual and auditory content raises concerns about misinformation, privacy breaches, and potential misuse of digital media.

## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

Despite its potential, **making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● **Technical Limitations**

Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

### ● **Ethical and Privacy Concerns**

Besides technical hurdles, ethical and privacy issues arise with talking photo technology. Manipulating visual and auditory content raises concerns about misinformation, privacy breaches, and potential misuse of digital media.

## Part 2\. How Does iPhone Talking Emoji Work?

Ever tried those fun Snapchat lenses? The **talking emoji on Apple** devices works in a similar fashion to Snapchat lenses. But instead of relying on custom masks from Snapchat, it uses popular emojis.

Animoji takes advantage of the TrueDepth camera system and the iPhone's internal chip to use Face ID technology. Apple first introduced Face ID in 2017 with the iPhone X. Now, all newer iPhone models come equipped with Face ID.

So you can use and make Animoji on iPhone X or later. You can also use it on the iPad Pro 11-inch or the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) and newer models.
