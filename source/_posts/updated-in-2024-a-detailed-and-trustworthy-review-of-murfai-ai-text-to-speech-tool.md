Markdown provides a structured way to organize your content. Alternatively, if you have a presentation in PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Keynote, you can use the speaker notes section to write your script. This way, you're aligning your visual content with the spoken narration.

### 1\. Migration, Travel, and Settlements

Throughout history, the world has seen many languages spread across the world. Travel has always been one of the primary reasons.

### 2\. Colonization and Imperialism
