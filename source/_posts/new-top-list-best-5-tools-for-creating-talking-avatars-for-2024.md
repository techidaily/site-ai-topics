## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

Despite its potential, **making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.
