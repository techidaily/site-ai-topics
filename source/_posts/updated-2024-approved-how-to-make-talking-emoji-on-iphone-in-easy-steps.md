## Bonus: What Kind of Anime Pictures Are Suitable to Make Talking Animation

As we have mentioned before, you can also upload anime photos in Wondershare Virbo and make the animated character talk. However, you need to note that these photos must meet specific criteria to ensure optimal results in your animations before trying on **how to make animation talk**.

Some anime picture specifications you can use to make a talking cartoon video:

1. **Having clear features**

Opt for anime pictures with well-defined and easily recognizable features to achieve more accurate results. Wondershare Virbo usually won’t detect anime pictures with simple lines or undefined lines.

1. **Free of copyright infringement**

 It's essential to use images that are free from any copyright restrictions or infringement. Only use anime character photos that you have the legal right to use, whether they are from your personal collection or obtained from royalty-free sources.

1. **Proper lighting and resolution**

Images with proper lighting and high resolution are essential for achieving crisp and detailed animations. Avoid images that are overly dark, blurry, or pixelated, as they may result in less visually appealing animations.

1. **Facing forward with a clear and visible face**

Select images where the anime character is facing forward and their face is clearly visible. This allows for precise facial animation, including lip-syncing and expression changes, which are key elements in creating realistic talking animations.

## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

Despite its potential, **making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://estore.winxdvd.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=12653853&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/bcb41ccdc4363c6848a1d760f26c28a0/products/14_videoproc-converter-ai-box.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### ● **Technical Limitations**

Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.

## Part 2\. Difficulties in Talking Photo Technology

![talking photo difficulties](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/02/how-to-make-a-picture-speak-03.jpg)

Despite its potential, **making your photos talk** encounters numerous challenges that hinder its seamless integration and effectiveness. Here, we outline some difficulties you might encounter:

### ● **Unnatural Mouth Shape**

Despite advancements in facial recognition and animation, creating natural-looking mouth movements in talking photos remains a significant challenge. The technology often struggles to accurately replicate the intricate movements and subtleties of human speech.

### ● **Unnatural AI Voice**

Another obstacle lies in the synthesis of natural-sounding AI voices. While text-to-speech (TTS) technology has advanced significantly, AI-generated voices can still sound robotic or unnatural. They often lack the nuances and inflections of human speech. Crafting a voice that is clear and emotionally resonant poses a significant challenge, as it involves capturing human expression and intonation nuances.

### ● **Lack of Lip Non-Actuation in Multi-Person Conversation Photos**

In multi-person conversation photos, accurately synchronizing lip movements poses a complex challenge. Coordinating lip movements and distinguishing speakers is challenging, especially in dynamic group settings with diverse expressions and speech patterns.

### ● **Technical Limitations**

Real-time lip-syncing and audio processing require a lot of computer power. Handling large amounts of data while keeping quality needs efficient algorithms. Additionally, it's hard to balance performance and resources in talking photo technology.
