The AM01 mini PC is reminiscent of the Macintosh Classic and is available in multiple configurations. The AM01 is much smaller than the Macintosh Classic, but it’s packed with features and can be purchased with a memory configuration of between 8 and 32GB and primary SSD storage options of up to 1TB.</p><p> Ayaneo updated its AM01 mini PC<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/ayaneo-am01-macintosh-esque-mini-pc-design-gets-an-amd-zen-3-upgrade" >a few weeks ago <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the Ryzen 7 5800U variant. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800U is an older CPU — launched in 2021 — and is based on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-zen-4-epyc-rome-milan-genoa-architecture-microarchitecture,40561.html" >Zen 3 architecture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> featuring on-chip Radeon Vega 8 graphics. Only time will tell if the company will provide a newer version of this retro-looking mini PC with updated CPUs.</p><p> The AM01 mini PC offers a 2280 M.2 port using PCIe 3.0 bandwidth and an SATA port for secondary storage, dual DDR4 SO-DIMM ports, and CPU options of Ryzen 3 3200U, Ryzen 7 5700U, or Ryzen 7 5800U (listed in specs but not currently sold on the site). It’s cooled by a 35-watt fan with an aluminum heatsink with four copper heat pipes. Its dimensions are 5.2 x 5.2 x 2.38 inches (132 x 132 x 60.5mm), and it has plenty of I&#x2F;O options.</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><p><strong>Ayaneo Retro Mini PC AM01 Specification</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>CPU</th><th>AMD Ryzen 7 5800U&#x2F; 5700U</th><th>AMD Ryzen 3 3200U</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Memory</td><td>8 &#x2F; 16 &#x2F; 32GB DDR4</td><td>8 &#x2F; 16GB DDR4</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>Bare System has no memory of hard drive</td><td>Row 2 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 3 - Cell 0</td><td>256GB &#x2F; 512GB &#x2F; 1TB (AMD Ryzen 7 5800U version without 8GB+256GB configuration</td><td>256 &#x2F; 512 GB</td></tr><tr><td>Row 4 - Cell 0</td><td>1x M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 slot &#x2F; Support NVMe and SATA SSD</td><td>Row 4 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 5 - Cell 0</td><td>1x SATA III Interface &#x2F; Support 2.5” SSD and HDD (bracket required)</td><td>Row 5 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Connect</td><td>Wi-Fi 6 &#x2F; BT 5.2 | m.2 2280</td><td>Wi-Fi 5 &#x2F; BT 4.2 | m.2 2280</td></tr><tr><td>Row 7 - Cell 0</td><td>1000Mbps on onboard NIC with remote wake-up support</td><td>Row 7 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Interface Type</td><td>1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type C (Data Only)</td><td>Row 8 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 9 - Cell 0</td><td>3x USB-A 3.2 Gen2</td><td>Row 9 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 10 - Cell 0</td><td>1x USB-A 2.0</td><td>Row 10 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 11 - Cell 0</td><td>1x HDMI 2.0</td><td>Row 11 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 12 - Cell 0</td><td>1x DP 1.4</td><td>Row 12 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 13 - Cell 0</td><td>1x 3.5mm Headphone Jack</td><td>Row 13 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 14 - Cell 0</td><td>1x RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Port</td><td>Row 14 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 15 - Cell 0</td><td>1x DC Power Connector</td><td>Row 15 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Dissipation</td><td>35-Watt large size high pressure turbo fan</td><td>Row 16 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Row 17 - Cell 0</td><td>Four copper tube heat dissipation module total aluminum fin area 60008.0 mm²”</td><td>Row 17 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Power Rating</td><td>12v 6A &#x2F; 7A (Depending on specific model)</td><td>Row 18 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>132 x 132 x 60.5mm (including feet, 64.5mm)</td><td>Row 19 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>Standard edition: 486g &#x2F; Barebone edition: 466g</td><td>Row 20 - Cell 2</td></tr><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 11 64-bit Home Edition&#x2F; Barebone</td><td>Row 21 - Cell 2</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGEpGR8Pts2g8USJ2KBFfh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Ayaneo AM01 Mini PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Ayaneo)</p><p> The pricing is fairly attractive, with the highest-spec options retailing at $449 including shipping, though customs charges may vary depending on country.

The camera itself has a plastic, silver housing with a shiny silver focus ring on the end. It feels like it could break at any moment. The base is made of a transparent plastic, which is also available in blue and black. The plastic is so rigid that we expect it to break under regular use. Every time we adjusted the camera, the plastic creaked like a rusty door in a haunted house. Even in our short testing period, the joints started getting loose. We had to check several times just to make sure it wasn’t broken.</p><p> The base looks like a binder clip with a hinge on the back end. The front of the camera houses the focus ring, which twists to focus in or out but doesn’t turn very smoothly. When we used it for the first time, it didn’t feel like it was supposed to rotate at all. Just like everything else, the focus ring feels like it will crack or fall out at any moment. One side of the clip has a squishy pad to keep the camera from slipping when it’s mounted on a smooth surface. The two are connected by a ball joint, which allows the camera to spin around 360 degrees and tilt approximately 15 degrees forward or backward or side to side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/a_8Gd66JN0RtfWzKKcRq95S8EmY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_6_Final_Horiz-1dd3a45479614483b0f4f5883f27094a.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Setup-process-Awkward-to-position"><a href="#Setup-process-Awkward-to-position" class="headerlink" title="Setup process: Awkward to position"></a><strong>Setup process: Awkward to position</strong></h2><p> It takes almost no time to get the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel up and running. We just plugged the USB cord into the computer and it worked.</p><p> It was easy to set up when we clipped it to a laptop, but terrible when we tried to put it on our HD TV. Every time we moved the computer or the USB cable, the camera slid, twisted, or fell off the TV. The ball joint, which connects the camera to the base, didn’t move smoothly, so we struggled to point the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel in the right direction, and we were too worried about breaking the plastic to try and force it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075462/7443" target="_top" id="2075462">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075462" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075462/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised"><a href="#Camera-Quality-Not-even-close-to-advertised" class="headerlink" title="Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised"></a><strong>Camera Quality: Not even close to advertised</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that. We tested the resolution by taking photos through photobooth, and they were only 640 x 480, or .31 megapixels. We tested the video resolution by using an online webcam testing tool, and it showed exactly the same results. The manufacturer claims the camera has 38 times more resolution than it actually does. We should have known that the manufacturer’s claims were too good to be true given the $8 asking price, but claiming a disparity that huge is really brazen.</p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is advertised as a 12 megapixel camera capable of HD video, but it wasn’t even close to that.</p><p> We tested the camera’s field of view by placing it 13.5 inches from a wall and measuring the field of view, 8.25 inches. After running those measurements through some trigonometric calculations, we found that it has a 34 degree field of view. The camera also has a surprising amount of distortion. Vertical lines in the background had a significant tilt backwards, and we saw tremendous barrel distortion everywhere except for the very center of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/BxI5asxQavdUO5cT3iIpSIqM9Mk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Docooler_USB2_12MegapixelWebCam_1LW4065141_10_Final_Horiz-8acc6be9290c439496f17a63684115ae.jpg"                      alt="Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; James Huenink</p><h2 id="Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio"><a href="#Performance-Underwhelming-performance-in-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio"></a><strong>Performance: Underwhelming performance in video and audio</strong></h2><p> We used<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-on-mac-4175436" >Photobooth <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-make-hd-skype-calls-3426508" >Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to test out the video and audio performance using the webcam for recording and<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-web-conferencing-tools-2377241" >conference calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It was difficult to position the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel correctly, because by the time we clipped it on and sat down, the camera had slipped out of position. This happened several times before we finally resigned ourselves to using a tilted camera in our calls.</p><p> The limited field of view and the distortions weren’t a problem when we tried a single-person call, but it would be a big problem for a group. It would be difficult to get everyone into the picture unless your table was very narrow and far away from the camera.</p><p> The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><p> We had trouble getting the focus right, too. The focus ring was hard to turn, so we had to put our hand over the lense to get a good grip. We turned the ring a little, and then we’d pull away to check the focus. Then we’d repeat until it was ready, a frustrating experience.</p><p> The audio performance of the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel was also lackluster. The built-in microphone produced poor quality sound, and when we tested it on Skype, voices were both muffled and echoey. People on the other end could understand what we were saying, but it was an unpleasant experience.</p><h2 id="Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam"><a href="#Price-Cheap-price-even-cheaper-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam"></a><strong>Price: Cheap price, even cheaper webcam</strong></h2><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is the most inexpensive webcam you can buy, ranging from $8 up to around $15, but there’s a reason it’s priced so low. The image and audio quality are both terrible, and the camera is difficult to use.</p><h2 id="Competition-Falls-short"><a href="#Competition-Falls-short" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Falls short"></a><strong>Competition: Falls short</strong></h2><p><strong><em>Logitech C270</em> :</strong> The Logitech C270 is a low-cost webcam that goes for $40 MSRP, though you can frequently find it for approximately $20. For $10 more than the Docooler, you get a big upgrade. It has 720p video calling and takes photos at 3MP. The microphone filters out background noise, so it shouldn’t have the same echo effects as the Docooler Web Cam. Even though it’s twice the price, you get a lot more camera for your ten bucks.</p><p><strong><em>HXSJ USB Webcam 480P HD</em> :</strong> We were most disappointed with the false claims about the Docooler webcam’s resolution, but HXSJ sells what looks like the same camera with honest advertising. In fact, the design, the frame, and just about everything else looks nearly identical to the Docooler webcam. Even the price is close to the same. We think the honest claims about the HXSJ should be rewarded, so we’d definitely recommend buying this camera over the Docooler.</p><p><strong><em>Coromose USB 50MP HD</em> :</strong> The Coromose USB 50MP HD looks exactly like the Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, down to the last detail. The base and camera look exactly alike, even the writing on the focus ring, and they go for about the same price, $8. There is no way, however, that this camera can do 50MP. It’s the same camera saddled even more egregious, deceptive marketing.</p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Impossible to recommend.</strong></p><p> The Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel is one of the most inexpensive cameras on the market for a reason. This camera doesn’t come close to delivering what it promises, meaning it’s not worth even the trifle you’d pay for it.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  USB 2.0 12 Megapixel</li><li>Product Brand  Docooler</li><li>UPC  B00OB883F6</li><li>Price  $8.00</li><li>Weight  2.5 oz.</li><li>Product Dimensions  3.75 x 1.5 x 3 in.</li><li>Color  Transparent, blue, black</li><li>Connections  USB 2.0 A cord 56.25” long</li><li>Aperture  F&#x2F;2 - F&#x2F;4</li><li>Focus  Manual Focus 8mm to infinity</li><li>Field of vision  34 degrees</li><li>Resolution  640 x 480; 12 MP claimed, 0.31 MP tested</li><li>Frame rate  30fps</li><li>What’s Included  Docooler USB 2.0 12 Megapixel, Quick Start Guide</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-elevate-youtube-presence-ideal-release-windows/"><u>[New] Elevate Youtube Presence Ideal Release Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-switching-on-windows-11-for-automatic-hdr-mode/"><u>[New] Switching On Windows 11 for Automatic HDR Mode</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/nlocking-the-vault-the-wealth-of-mr-beast/"><u>[New] Unlocking the Vault The Wealth of Mr. Beast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-nostalgic-gaming-empathetic-3ds-on-android-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Nostalgic Gaming Empathetic 3DS on Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/20plus-effective-ways-to-acquire-czech-fast-and-well/"><u>20+ Effective Ways to Acquire Czech Fast & Well</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-skype-the-top-10-audio-capture-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Skype The Top 10 Audio Capture Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-5-best-tools-to-convert-text-to-audio-online-for-free/"><u>2024 Approved Top 5 Best Tools to Convert Text to Audio Online for Free</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-savvy.techidaily.com/5-unconventional-ways-to-leverage-chatbots/"><u>5 Unconventional Ways to Leverage ChatBots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/exploring-ai-face-generators/"><u>Exploring AI Face Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/how-to-generate-speech-from-text-the-top-text-to-speech-converters-for-2024/"><u>How To Generate Speech From Text | The Top Text-to-Speech Converters for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-12-pro-online-here-are-6-easy-ways-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How to Unlock Apple iPhone 12 Pro Online?

What is an AI artist?</strong></h2><p>AI artist refers to an artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to create art autonomously or assist human artists in their creative process. AI artists use machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques to analyze and understand patterns in existing artworks and generate new art based on that knowledge.</p><p>Some AI artists can create paintings, drawings, or digital art, while others can generate music, poetry, or video content. They work by learning from a vast dataset of existing artworks or creative content and then producing original pieces that mimic the style, themes, or elements present in those examples.</p><p>AI artists are not meant to replace human creativity but rather to augment it and inspire new ideas. They can be valuable tools for artists to experiment with different styles, generate concepts, or overcome creative blocks. AI art is continually evolving, and the creations of AI artists often spark discussions about the intersection of technology and creativity in the art world.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-AI-artists"><a href="#Part-2-Guidelines-for-responsible-use-of-AI-artists" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You can apply these troubleshooting methods on iPhone 7, iPhone 8, iPhone 11, iPhone SE, iPhone XR, iPhone 12, iPhone 13, and iPhone 14, running on iOS 16, iOS 15, iOS 14, iOS 13, or below versions.</p><p> Let’s walk through the solutions one by one to fix YouTube videos not working on iPhone.</p><h3 id="1-Ensure-good-speed-Internet"><a href="#1-Ensure-good-speed-Internet" class="headerlink" title="1.Ensure good speed Internet"></a>1.<strong>Ensure good speed Internet</strong></h3><p> First thing to check and fix is your mobile network speed. YouTube won’t work, if your Internet is slow or poor. Get a stable and high-speed WiFi or cellular data to play YouTube videos seamlessly on iPhone.</p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-and-on-iPhone-internet"><a href="#2-Turn-off-and-on-iPhone-internet" class="headerlink" title="2.Turn off and on iPhone internet"></a>2.<strong>Turn off and on iPhone internet</strong></h3><p> If the Internet speed is good enough, a network glitch may be preventing YouTube videos to open on iPhone. Just turn off and then turn on your Wi-Fi or cellular data. It is the quickest way to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/stellardata-recovery/buy-now/" >fix unable to load video error in YouTube on iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Whether YouTube video shows buffering or black screen, the solution works.</p><h3 id="3-Disable-Airplane-mode"><a href="#3-Disable-Airplane-mode" class="headerlink" title="3.Disable Airplane mode"></a>3.<strong>Disable Airplane mode</strong></h3><p> If YouTube is not working on iPhone, check if the Airplane Mode is not turned on. Airplane Mode disconnects network connections, including WiFi, cellular data, and Bluetooth. Disable Airplane mode on your iPhone by clicking on the plane icon in the control center.</p><p> You can also turn off Airplane Mode from the iPhone’s Settings by clicking on the Airplane Mode option to disable it.</p><h3 id="4-Restart-or-reboot-your-iPhone"><a href="#4-Restart-or-reboot-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="4.Restart or reboot your iPhone"></a>4.<strong>Restart or reboot your iPhone</strong></h3><p> Simply restart or reboot your iPhone. This fix has worked innumerable times to resolve iPhone video problems.</p><p> To restart iPhone 14, 13, 12, 11, SE, X, 8, 7 press and hold the volume button and the side button&#x2F;s until you see the power-off slider. Next, drag the slider to turn off your iPhone. To turn it on, press and hold the right side button of the iPhone until the Apple logo appears. Now open YouTube and check if the videos are playing properly.</p><p> In case your iPhone is not responding or freezes,<a class="link"   href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/force-restart-iphone-iph8903c3ee6/ios" >force restart it. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Turn-off-VPN-on-iPhone"><a href="#5-Turn-off-VPN-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="5.Turn off VPN on iPhone"></a>5.<strong>Turn off VPN on iPhone</strong></h3><p> Have you set up a VPN on your iPhone to browse Internet privately? VPN stops access to certain online content geography-wise. Maybe that’s the reason for YouTube videos not playing on your iPhone. To fix YouTube videos not playing on iPhone, turn off VPN.</p><p> On your iPhone, move to<strong>Settings &gt; General</strong> and toggle off VPN slider to disconnect.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135410/19272" target="_top" id="2135410">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135410" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135410/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Clear-the-iPhone-cache"><a href="#6-Clear-the-iPhone-cache" class="headerlink" title="6.Clear the iPhone cache"></a>6.<strong>Clear the iPhone cache</strong></h3><p> Apps and browsing activities create cache, cookies, and temp files on iPhone. These non-essential files pile up and affect your iOS device performance and occupy storage space. So cache and cookies could be a reason for YouTube not working on iPhone. Delete cache and cookies to improve your iPhone’s performance and speed.

If you can’t fix the Internet issue and desperately want to access YouTube, decrease its video quality from the settings.</p><p> Although not in high quality, the video will play in an acceptable resolution without any buffering or error.</p><p><strong>To reduce video quality in YouTube follow the given steps:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Open the video in YouTube.</p></li><li><p>Click on the 3 dots.</p></li><li><p>Select<strong>Quality &gt; Advanced</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Select a lower video quality from the options.

You may be trying to open and watch them inside the chat application.</p><p> Instead, try to open the videos in the YouTube app. If the videos don’t play in the YouTube app, copy the link and play from the Safari browser on iPhone.</p><h3 id="9-Re-sign-into-your-YouTube-account"><a href="#9-Re-sign-into-your-YouTube-account" class="headerlink" title="9.Re-sign into your YouTube account"></a>9.<strong>Re-sign into your YouTube account</strong></h3><p> If you have logged out of YouTube, you cannot add comments or save playlists. You can only search and watch YouTube videos without signing in. Make sure you are signed in to your YouTube account to access its full features.</p><p> So if YouTube is not working on iPhone, sign out of the application once. Then sign in again to open your YouTube account.</p><p><strong>To sign out of your YouTube account on iPhone:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Click on your profile photo and tap on the account name.</p></li><li><p>Click<strong>Switch Account</strong> option.</p></li><li><p>Click on<strong>Use YouTube Signed Out</strong> option.</p></li></ul><p> <strong>To sign in again on YouTube on iPhone:</strong></p><ul><li>In the YouTube app, click on<strong>Account</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Sign in</strong> .</li><li>Select from an existing account, or click on<strong>Add account</strong> to login with a new account on your iPhone.</li></ul><p> Once logged in, you should be able to work on YouTube without any issue.</p><h3 id="10-Update-the-iPhone-software"><a href="#10-Update-the-iPhone-software" class="headerlink" title="10.Update the iPhone software"></a>10.<strong>Update the iPhone software</strong></h3><p> I always recommend software updates to fix technical glitches.

Not just update the YouTube app on iPhone but also your iOS.</p><p><strong>To update iPhone iOS, the steps are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>On your iPhone, open<strong>Settings &gt; General &gt;</strong> <strong>Software update</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Click on<strong>Automatic Updates</strong> .</p></li><li><p>Turn on<strong>Download iOS Updates</strong> and<strong>Install iOS Updates</strong> to update iPhone to the latest iOS version.</p></li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1972693/19272" target="_top" id="1972693">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1972693" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1972693/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="11-Update-YouTube-app"><a href="#11-Update-YouTube-app" class="headerlink" title="11.

The Incognito mode in YouTube only allows watching videos privately without saving your searches or activity. However, the private mode doesn’t let you engage with a YouTube video. This means you cannot like, comment, share, subscribe to a channel, or save YouTube videos. You won’t be able to see your subscriptions also in Incognito mode.</p><p> So if YouTube videos are not working on iPhone, check and turn off the Incognito mode.</p><p><strong>Steps to turn off Incognito mode in YouTube on iPhone:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Open YouTube app and tap on the profile picture.</p></li><li><p>Click on<strong>Turn off Incognito</strong> . Now, YouTube will start working as usual.</p></li></ul><h3 id="13-Reset-Network-Settings-of-iPhone"><a href="#13-Reset-Network-Settings-of-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="13.Reset Network Settings of iPhone"></a>13.<strong>Reset Network Settings of iPhone</strong></h3><p> YouTube videos not working on iPhone could be a network issue.

Four Key Components of AI Face Generators"></a>Part 2. Four Key Components of AI Face Generators</h2><p>AI face generators are complex systems that harness deep learning capabilities to craft lifelike facial images. Understanding their key components is essential to appreciating how these systems create convincing synthetic faces.</p><h3 id="1-Generator-Network"><a href="#1-Generator-Network" class="headerlink" title="1. Generator Network"></a>1. Generator Network</h3><p>At the heart of an AI face generator is the generator network. This network learns to transform random noise or latent vectors into detailed and coherent facial images. The generator deciphers patterns in the latent space through layers of neural connections to generate different facial features like eyes, nose, and mouth. As the network refines its understanding through training, it becomes increasingly adept at producing realistic faces.</p><h3 id="2-Discriminator-Network"><a href="#2-Discriminator-Network" class="headerlink" title="2. Discriminator Network"></a>2. Discriminator Network</h3><p>The discriminator network acts as the critic in the AI face generator setup. It learns to distinguish between authentic images and those generated by the generator. This adversarial dynamic between the generator and discriminator drives the overall improvement of the generated images. The generator strives to create images that can “fool” the discriminator into classifying them as accurate while the discriminator hones its ability to tell the difference.</p><h3 id="3-Latent-Space-and-Noise-Vector"><a href="#3-Latent-Space-and-Noise-Vector" class="headerlink" title="3. Latent Space and Noise Vector"></a>3. Latent Space and Noise Vector</h3><p>The latent space is a multidimensional mathematical space where the generator operates. It’s a representation of all possible facial features that the generator can create. A noise vector, often random values, serves as the starting point in the latent space. As the generator refines these noise vectors through its network layers, they transform into intricate facial characteristics, creating diverse and unique faces.</p><h3 id="4-Loss-Functions"><a href="#4-Loss-Functions" class="headerlink" title="4. Loss Functions"></a>4. Loss Functions</h3><p>Loss functions are crucial in training AI face generators, particularly in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The generator’s loss function encourages it to create images convincing to the discriminator. The discriminator’s loss function aims to correctly classify authentic and generated images. The interplay between these loss functions compels both networks to improve iteratively, resulting in increasingly realistic facial photos.</p><h3 id="5-Training-Data-and-Preprocessing"><a href="#5-Training-Data-and-Preprocessing" class="headerlink" title="5. Training Data and Preprocessing"></a>5. Training Data and Preprocessing</h3><p>The quality of training data significantly impacts the AI face generator’s output. Diverse and representative datasets containing images of various ages, ethnicities, and expressions contribute to more realistic results. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and augmentation ensure consistency and enhance the generator’s capacity to generate coherent faces.</p><h3 id="6-Styling-and-Customization"><a href="#6-Styling-and-Customization" class="headerlink" title="6. Styling and Customization"></a>6. Styling and Customization</h3><p>Advanced AI face generators can incorporate styling and customization options. These allow users to influence specific attributes of the generated faces, such as hairstyle, facial hair, or accessories. This customization capability enhances the generator’s versatility for various applications, from character design in gaming to creating unique avatars.</p><p>Understanding these key components provides insight into the inner workings of AI face generators. These systems leverage the interplay of networks, data, and mathematical spaces to achieve their remarkable ability to generate facial images that blur the line between natural and synthetic.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Understanding-AI-Face-Generators-1"><a href="#Part-1-Understanding-AI-Face-Generators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is an AI headshot generator?"></a>Part 1. What is an AI headshot generator?</h2><p>An AI headshot generator is a software or application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic and high-quality headshot images of individuals. These generators use deep learning techniques to produce lifelike portraits from scratch, often employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).</p><p>Users typically provide input to the AI headshot generator, such as specifying certain attributes or characteristics they want in the generated image, like age, gender, ethnicity, facial expression, and more. The AI then processes this input and generates a corresponding headshot that matches the desired criteria.</p><p>These generators can be used for various purposes, including creating profile pictures, avatars, character images for games or storytelling, and even for artistic or creative projects. It’s worth noting that while these generators can produce impressive results, they might sometimes unintentionally perpetuate certain biases present in the training data, which is an important consideration when using such tools.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982499">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982499">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982499.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982499%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982499/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion"><a href="#Part-2-Can-AI-created-headshots-be-used-in-professional-occasion" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What is an AI text generator?"></a>Part 1. What is an AI text generator?</h2><p>An AI text generator, also known as a language model, is a software or system that uses artificial intelligence techniques, particularly natural language processing (NLP), to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Through extensive training on large volumes of text data, these models acquire knowledge of patterns, grammar, and semantics, enabling them to generate cohesive and contextually appropriate text.</p><p>Such as OpenAI, AI text generators can produce a wide range of text, including articles, stories, emails, product descriptions, etc. They can be used for various purposes, such as content creation, chatbots, virtual assistants, and even assisting in writing and editing tasks. The generated text aims to mimic human language and can be customized based on prompts or specific requirements.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-working-principle-of-AI-text-generators"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-working-principle-of-AI-text-generators" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What’s the working principle of AI text generators?"></a>Part 2. What’s the working principle of AI text generators?</h2><p>The AI text generator operates primarily based on deep learning and natural language processing techniques. It uses neural network models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or variants such as extended short-term memory networks (LSTMs) or transformer models.</p><p>During the training phase, the AI text generator receives vast text data as input. This data can include books, articles, web pages, conversational records, and more. The model learns natural language patterns by analyzing the statistical characteristics, grammar rules, and semantic associations present in the text data.</p><p>The generation of text occurs character by character or word by word. During the generation process, the model predicts the next character or phrase based on the input context and preceding text, ensuring coherence and relevance in the generated output. The objective is to generate text that aligns with the input information and flows naturally.</p><p>To enhance the quality of the generated text, AI text generators often undergo extensive pre-training and fine-tuning processes. In the pre-training phase, the model is trained on massive amounts of text data to learn the fundamental features of the language. The model is further adjusted and optimized in the fine-tuning phase through supervised training on specific tasks.</p><h2 id="Part-3-In-which-scenarios-can-AI-text-generators-be-applied"><a href="#Part-3-In-which-scenarios-can-AI-text-generators-be-applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.
